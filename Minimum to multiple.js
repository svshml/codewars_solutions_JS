Given two integers a and x, return the minimum non-negative number to add to / subtract from a to make it a multiple of x.

minimum(10, 6)  //= 2

10+2 = 12 which is a multiple of 6
Note
0 is always a multiple of x
Constraints
1 <= a <= 106

1 <= x <= 105
*/

function minimum(a, x) {
 return Math.abs(Math.round(a / x)*x - a );
}

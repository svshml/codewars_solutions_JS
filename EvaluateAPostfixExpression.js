Imagine you are in a universe where you can just perform the following arithematic operations. Addition(+), Subtraction(-), Multiplication(*), Division(/). 
You are given given a postfix expression. Postfix expression is where operands come after operator. Each operator and operand are seperated by a space. 
You need to evaluate the expression.

For example: 25 45 + is equivalent of 25 + 45, hence the answer would be 70. Instead if you are given 20 40 + 60 *, it is equivalent of (20+40) * 60, 
hence the answer should be 3600. 20 40 60 + * is equivalent of 20 * (40 + 60) = 2000.

Create a method 'evaluate' that takes a string as input and returns a long resulted in the evaluation. Just concentrate on happy paths. 
Assume that expression is always valid and division is always an integer division.
